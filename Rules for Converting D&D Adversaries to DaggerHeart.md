## **Introduction**

This document presents a framework of rules and guidelines for converting adversaries from Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (D\&D 5e) to the DaggerHeart system. The conversion takes into account the fundamental differences between the two systems, including level scales, design philosophies, and game mechanics.

## **Fundamental Differences Between Systems**

### **Adversary Structure**

* **D\&D 5e**: Monsters have complete statistics (Strength, Dexterity, etc.), hit points, armor class, attacks, special abilities, and resistances.  
* **DaggerHeart**: Adversaries have Difficulty, Thresholds (damage thresholds), HP, Stress, attack modifier, and Features (passives, actions, and reactions).

### **Combat Philosophy**

* **D\&D 5e**: More tactical combat, focusing on resources, positioning, and attrition over multiple encounters.  
* **DaggerHeart**: More narrative combat, focusing on dramatic moments, interesting tactics, and narrative consequences.

## **Level Conversion Table**

The conversion from D\&D Challenge Rating (CR) to DaggerHeart Tier follows this structure:

| Challenge Rating (D\&D) | Tier (DaggerHeart) | Equivalent Character Levels |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 \- 2 | 1 | Level 1 |
| 3 \- 7 | 2 | Levels 2-4 |
| 8 \- 14 | 3 | Levels 5-7 |
| 15+ | 4 | Levels 8-10 |

## 

## **Converting Basic Statistics**

### **Difficulty**

Difficulty in DaggerHeart is the value that players need to match or exceed in their tests against the adversary. Convert from D\&D's Armor Class (AC) and Saving Throws:

| Challenge Rating (D\&D) | Base Difficulty (DaggerHeart) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 \- 1/4 | 10-11 |
| 1/2 \- 2 | 12-13 |
| 3 \- 7 | 14-15 |
| 8 \- 14 | 16-17 |
| 15+ | 18-20 |

***Adjustments**: Add \+1 for monsters with high AC or good saving throws in D\&D. Subtract \-1 for monsters with low AC or weak saving throws.*

### **Thresholds**

Thresholds determine when an adversary suffers Major or Severe damage:

| Challenge Rating (D\&D) | Thresholds (Major/Severe) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 \- 1/4 | 6/10 |
| 1/2 \- 2 | 8/14 |
| 3 \- 7 | 10/18 |
| 8 \- 14 | 12/22 |
| 15+ | 15/28 |

### 

### 

### **Hit Points (HP)**

HP in DaggerHeart are generally lower than in D\&D. Use this formula:

**HP in DaggerHeart \= (HP in D\&D ÷ Conversion Factor)**

| Challenge Rating (D\&D) | Conversion Factor |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 \- 1/4 | 6-8 |
| 1/2 \- 2 | 10-12 |
| 3 \- 7 | 15-20 |
| 8 \- 14 | 25-30 |
| 15+ | 35-40 |

***Minimum**: Adversaries should always have at least 3 HP.*

### **Stress**

Stress represents the adversary's mental resistance:

| Type of Adversary in D\&D | Stress in DaggerHeart |
| :---: | :---: |
| Creatures without intelligence (Beasts, Plants) | 1-2 |
| Creatures with low intelligence | 3-4 |
| Creatures with average intelligence | 5-6 |
| Creatures with high intelligence | 7-8 |
| Creatures with exceptional intelligence | 9-10 |

***Adjustments**: Add \+2 for creatures with resistance to psychic damage or mental effects in D\&D.*

### **Attack Modifier (ATK)**

The attack modifier in DaggerHeart is simpler:

| Challenge Rating (D\&D) | Attack Modifier (DaggerHeart) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 \- 1/4 | \+0 to \+1 |
| 1/2 \- 2 | \+1 to \+2 |
| 3 \- 7 | \+2 to \+3 |
| 8 \- 14 | \+3 to \+4 |
| 15+ | \+4 to \+5 |

***Adjustments**: Use the higher value for monsters with high attack bonuses in D\&D.*

### **Standard Attack Damage**

Damage in DaggerHeart is more simplified:

| Challenge Rating (D\&D) | Standard Damage (DaggerHeart) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 \- 1/4 | 1d6 or 1d8 |
| 1/2 \- 2 | 1d8+1 or 1d10+1 |
| 3 \- 7 | 1d10+2 or 2d6+2 |
| 8 \- 14 | 2d8+3 or 2d10+3 |
| 15+ | 3d8+4 or 3d10+4 |

## **Converting Adversary Types**

In DaggerHeart, adversaries are classified into types that represent their role in combat:

| Type in D\&D | Type in DaggerHeart |
| :---: | :---: |
| Monsters with high damage and low defense | Standard |
| Monsters with high defense and resistance | Bruiser |
| Minions are easily dispatched, but dangerous in numbers | Minion |
| Supports enhance allies or disrupt the PCs | Support |
| Skulks are highly mobile, maneuvering to ambush | Skulk |
| Groups of weak monsters | Horde |
| Monsters with support/control abilities | Leader |
| Monsters with ranged attacks | Sniper |
| Monsters with high mobility | Skirmisher |
| Unique and powerful monsters | Solo or Legendary |

## **Converting Special Abilities**

D\&D special abilities should be converted to Features in DaggerHeart, which are divided into three main categories:

### **Passives**

Abilities that are always active or that automatically activate when a specific condition is met.

**Examples of Passives:**

* **Horde (X)** \- Passive: When the Horde has marked half or more of its HP, its standard attack deals X damage instead.  
* **Minion (X)** \- Passive: This adversary is defeated when it takes any damage. For every X damage a PC deals to this adversary, defeat an additional Minion within range that the attack would hit.  
* **Relentless (X)** \- Passive: This adversary can be spotlighted up to X times per conflict. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.  
* **Slow** \- Passive: When you spotlight this adversary and they don't have a token on their stat block, they can't act. Place a token on their stat block and describe what they're preparing to do. When you spotlight this adversary and they have a token, clear the token and they can act.  
* **Arcane Form** \- Passive: This adversary is resistant to magical damage.  
* **Armored Carapace (X)** \- Passive: When this adversary takes physical damage, reduce it by X.

### **Actions**

Abilities that the adversary can actively use during their turn.

**Examples of Actions that use Fear:**

* **Explosion** \- Action: Spend a Fear to erupt in a fiery explosion. Make an attack against all targets within Close range. Targets the adversary succeeds against take 1d8 magic damage and are knocked back to Far range.  
* **More Where That Came From** \- Action: Summon three Jagged Knife Lackeys, who appear at Far range.

**Examples of Actions that mark Stress:**

* **Tactician** \- Action: Mark a Stress to spotlight this adversary and two allies within Close range.

### **Reactions**

Abilities that the adversary can use in response to player actions.

**Examples of Reactions:**

* **Heavy Hitter** \- Reaction: When this adversary deals damage with a standard attack, you can spend a Fear to gain a \+X bonus to the damage roll.  
* **Team-Up** \- Reaction: When another adversary within Very Close range deals X damage to a creature, you can mark a Stress to make a standard attack against that same creature. On a success, combine the damage.  
* **Momentum** \- Reaction: When this adversary makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.

## **Converting Experiences**

Experiences in DaggerHeart represent areas of expertise for the adversary:

| Skills/Proficiencies in D\&D | Experience in DaggerHeart |
| :---: | :---: |
| Stealth, Sleight of Hand | Thief |
| Arcana, History, Religion | Scholar |
| Nature, Animal Handling, Survival | Wilderness |
| Athletics, Acrobatics | Athlete |
| Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation | Diplomat |

*The Experience value (+1, \+2, etc.) should be based on the corresponding skill bonus in D\&D.*

## **Motives and Tactics**

In DaggerHeart, each adversary has Motives and Tactics that guide their behavior:

1. Analyze the monster's description and behavior in D\&D  
2. Identify 2-4 main motivations or tactics  
3. List them in order of priority

**Example**: A red dragon might have: "Hoard treasure, Dominate by force, Burn enemies, Protect territory"

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Actions**  
**Multiattack.** The tarrasque can use its Swallow. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Frightful Presence in place of its bite.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (4d12 \+ 10\) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can't bite another target.

If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns. If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque.
