As a bonus action, the drone can move the orb and its contents up to Close in any direction. A successful casting of the Dispel Magic spell on the orb (Difficulty (15)) destroys it. The orb otherwise remains intact until the drone spends an action to end the effect or the drone is destroyed.

As a bonus action, the drone can move the orb and its contents up to Close in any direction. A successful casting of the Dispel Magic spell on the orb (Difficulty (15)) destroys it. The orb otherwise remains intact until the drone spends an action to end the effect or the drone is destroyed. A drone can have only one detention orb active at a time; if the drone creates a detention orb when it already has one active, the first orb disappears, freeing the creature inside."

Belashyrra can issue telepathic commands to the charmed creature (no action required), which it does its best to obey.3. Mind-Weakening Ray.

Each creature in that area must make a Agility Reaction Roll (18), taking 45 (10d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature dies if the breath reduces it to 0 hit points. Additionally, any Medium or smaller Humanoid killed by the breath's damage, as well as every corpse of such a creature within the cone, becomes a zombie (see the Monster Manual) under the dragon's control. The zombie acts on the dragon's initiative but immediately after the dragon's turn. Absent any other command, the zombie tries to kill any non-Undead creature it encounters."

Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range Very Close, one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) acid damage.2: Alchemist's Fire. The kobold throws a flask of alchemist's fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range Very Close, one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target's turns. The target can end this damage by using its action to make a Difficulty (10) Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.3: Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a Very Close-square space within Close of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.4: Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range Very Close, one target. Hit: 5 (1d10) acid damage, and the target is covered in slime until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the slime off. A target covered in the slime takes 5 (1d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.5: Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a Very Close-square space within Close of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs (in this book) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.6: Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a Very Close-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach Very Close, one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a Finesse Reaction Roll (9), taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.7: Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within Very Close of it. The skunk has a walking speed of Close, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within Very Close of it. The target must succeed on a Finesse Reaction Roll (9), or it retches and is incapacitated for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn't need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.8: Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a Very Close-square space within Close of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses."

Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.The golem's creator, if within Far of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a Difficulty (15) Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk.

If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within Close of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze."

It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to Close in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.7. Sleep Ray.

The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.8. Petrification Ray.

On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.If the basilisk sees its reflection within Close of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze."
