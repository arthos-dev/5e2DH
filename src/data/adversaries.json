The targeted creature must succeed on a Difficulty (14) Wisdom Reaction Roll or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a Difficulty (14) Constitution Reaction Roll or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the Reaction Roll at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a Difficulty (14) Wisdom Reaction Roll or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the Reaction Roll at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a Difficulty (14) Dexterity Reaction Roll. On a failed Reaction Roll, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the Reaction Roll at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a Difficulty (14) Constitution Reaction Roll, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed Reaction Roll, or half as much damage on a successful one.6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Difficulty (14) Strength Reaction Roll or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a Difficulty (14) Wisdom Reaction Roll or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a Difficulty (14) Dexterity Reaction Roll. On a failed Reaction Roll, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the Reaction Roll at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Difficulty (14) Dexterity Reaction Roll or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 HP, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.If the target is a Large or smaller non-magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a Reaction Roll. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a Difficulty (14) Dexterity Reaction Roll or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 HP."

This magical ability, which the Vistani call the Evil Eye, duplicates the duration and effect of the animal friendship, charm person, or hold person spell (Vistana's choice; spell Difficulty (10)), but requires neither somatic nor material components. If the target succeeds on the Reaction Roll, the Vistana is blinded until the end of the Vistana's next turn.A Vistana who uses Evil Eye can't use it again before finishing a short or long rest. Once a target succeeds on a Reaction Roll against a Vistana's Evil Eye, it is immune to the Evil Eye of all Vistani for 24 hours."
